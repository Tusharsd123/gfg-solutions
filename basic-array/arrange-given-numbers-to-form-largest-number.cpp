//Given two numbers X and Y, how should myCompare() decide which number to put first â€“ 
//we compare two numbers XY (Y appended at the end of X) and YX (X appended at the end of Y).
//If XY is larger, then X should come before Y in output, else Y should come before.
//For example, let X and Y be 542 and 60. To compare X and Y, we compare 54260 and 60542. Since 60542 is greater than 54260,
//we put Y first.

int myCompare(string X, string Y)

    // first append Y at the end of X 
    string XY = X.append(Y); 
  
    // then append X at the end of Y 
    string YX = Y.append(X); 
  
    // Now see which of the two formed numbers is greater 
    return XY.compare(YX) > 0 ? 1: 0;

// The function accepts a vector of strings
